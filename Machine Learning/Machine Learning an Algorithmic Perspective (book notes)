### Supervised learning
A training set of examples with targets (correct responses). <br>
The algorithm is based on this set to generalise correct responses. <br>
It's also called learning from "exemplars".<br>

### Unsupervised learning
Correct answers are not provided, but the algorithm tries to identify similarities between inputs to categorise inputs together. <br>
The statistical approach to unsupervised learning is known as **density estimation**.<br>

### Reinforcement learning
The algorithm gets told when the answer is incorrect, and try different possibilities until gets the right answer. <br>

### Evolutionary learning
The algorithm adapts to improve itself. <br>
